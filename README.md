# Self-motivated Responsive Web Design Projects 
These are my implementations of the project ideas provided on freeCodeCamp

List of Projects Completed 
1) Cat Photo App - Utilized key concepts of HTML tags to add photos, embedded links, and lists, and gather user input through buttons, checkboxes, and a submittable fill-in-the-blank.
2) Camper Cafe Menu - Interweaved HTML and CSS to create a stylized menu for a theoretical Camper Cafe. For the various headers, menu items, images, and classes I defined, I optimized the font, margins, color, and behavior under user input to create a more compact and concise look.
3) NBA Survey Form: I challenged myself to reinforce the concepts used previously to create a survey form that asks the responders & viewers of the NBA how to continue and improve the organizationâ€™s success. With each part I struggled with (i.e structuring of the classes and bugs with established elements), I was able to solve it by researching it online and shadowing more proficient programmers.
