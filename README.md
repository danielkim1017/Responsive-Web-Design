# Self-motivated Responsive Web Design Projects 
These are my implementations of the project ideas provided on freeCodeCamp

List of Projects Completed 
1) Cat Photo App - Utilized key concepts of HTML tags to add photos, embedded links, and lists, and gather user input through buttons, checkboxes, and a submittable fill-in-the-blank.
2) Camper Cafe Menu - Interweaved HTML and CSS to create a stylized menu for a theoretical Camper Cafe. For the various headers, menu items, images, and classes I defined, I optimized the font, margins, color, and behavior under user input to create a more compact and concise look.
